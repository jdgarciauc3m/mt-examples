# mt-examples: Multithreading examples

This repo contains a number of very simple examples on multi-threading.

## Goals

This repo has multiple goals:

- Modern C: The examples use modern C as much as possible (to the best of my
  knowledge).
- C versus C++ comparison: Each example in C has a C++ counter example.
